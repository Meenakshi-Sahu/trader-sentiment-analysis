Final Summary

>>Methodology

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed index) influences trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid.

First, trade-level data was aggregated to a daily account-level dataset. Key metrics were engineered including daily PnL, win rate, trading frequency (trades per day), average trade size (USD), total volume traded, and long/short directional bias.

Sentiment data was aligned at the daily level and merged with trader metrics.

The analysis was conducted across sentiment regimes (Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed) to examine differences in both performance and behavioral patterns.

Additionally, traders were segmented into:

**High vs Low frequency traders**

**Consistent vs Inconsistent traders**

**Behavioral clusters using K-Means clustering**

This allowed identification of structural differences in profitability across regimes and trader types.

>>Key Insights

**Insight 1 — Performance Varies Across Sentiment Regimes**

Trader performance differs meaningfully across regimes.
Extreme Greed shows the highest win rates and strong median profitability, indicating that momentum-driven environments benefit active traders.

Fear regimes exhibit the highest PnL volatility, reflecting greater dispersion in outcomes and increased risk exposure.

**Insight 2 — Behavior Changes During Fear Regimes**

Trading activity increases significantly during Fear periods:

Higher trades per day

Larger total traded volume

Slightly higher long bias

This suggests traders actively attempt to capture reversals or volatility spikes rather than reducing exposure.

**Insight 3 — Segmentation Reveals Performance Gaps**

High-frequency traders consistently outperform low-frequency traders across all regimes, with the largest advantage during Fear markets.

Consistent traders remain profitable across regimes, while inconsistent traders experience severe losses during Greed periods, indicating vulnerability to overconfidence-driven environments.

Clustering analysis further reveals that profitability is concentrated among highly active or capital-intensive trader archetypes.

>>Strategy Recommendations

**Strategy 1 — Regime-Based Risk Control**

During Greed regimes, apply stricter risk controls for historically inconsistent traders.
This may include reducing position size, limiting exposure, or tightening stop-loss thresholds.
Evidence suggests Greed periods amplify losses for weaker accounts.

**Strategy 2 — Volatility-Adjusted Activity Allocation**

During Fear regimes, allow higher trading activity for historically high-frequency and consistent traders.
These environments exhibit higher volatility and profit dispersion, where skilled active traders generate outsized returns.

However, exposure caps should remain in place for low-frequency or inconsistent accounts.

This framework supports regime-aware capital allocation and risk management decisions rather than uniform trading rules across market conditions.
